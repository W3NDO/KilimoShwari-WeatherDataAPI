# Kilimo Shwari

This is the backend server for my final year project, "Kilimo Shwari"

The project is a micro-insurance platform that will use smart contract hosted on the ethereum blockchain, a react native frontend and a RoR backend. 

The RoR server will gather weather data and serve it to a function that will execute the smart contract when the specified threshholds and requirements are met.

The react native app can be found [here](https://github.com/W3NDO/KilimoShwari-Mobi)

The Smart Contract can be found [here](https://github.com/W3NDO/KilimoShwari-SmartContract)
